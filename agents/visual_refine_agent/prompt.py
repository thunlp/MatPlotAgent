SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''Given a piece of code, a user query, and an image of the current plot, please determine whether the plot has faithfully followed the user query. Your task is to provide instruction to make sure the plot has strictly completed the requirements of the query. Please output a detailed step by step instruction on how to use python code to enhance the plot.'''

USER_PROMPT = '''Here is the code: [Code]:
"""
{{code}}
"""

Here is the user query: [Query]:
"""
{{query}}
"""

Carefully read and analyze the user query to understand the specific requirements. Examine the provided Python code to understand how the current plot is generated. Check if the code aligns with the user query in terms of data selection, plot type, and any specific customization. Look at the provided image of the plot. Assess the plot type, the data it represents, labels, titles, colors, and any other visual elements. Compare these elements with the requirements specified in the user query. Note any differences between the user query requirements and the current plot. Based on the identified discrepancies, provide step-by-step instructions on how to modify the Python code to meet the user query requirements. Suggest improvements for better visualization practices, such as clarity, readability, and aesthetics, while ensuring the primary focus is on meeting the user's specified requirements.

Remember to save the plot to a png file. The file name should be """{{file_name}}"""
